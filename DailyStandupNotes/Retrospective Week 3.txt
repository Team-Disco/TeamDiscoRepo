Nicholas
* Finished project 0 part 2 over the last sprint/week and ran into some issues with css and accessing slds assets but was able to overcome it through a bit of research and delving into how the project is set up.
* Going into the next sprint/week will work on at least finishing the set up for projects ahead of time to get a more accurate grasp on how long each project should take.
* Velocity for Sprint: 340 on a 1-100 scale per feature rating system.
