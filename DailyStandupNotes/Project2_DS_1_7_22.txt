Nicholas-worked on LWC planning and structuring phase, outling different fields, 
how it will communicate with other components. 
Barebones implementation by end of the day.  Will add more to the kanban board.


Matari-went over Aura components and I created one, create Accessory lwc component just to see
what it would look like for the Carful org.  I reviewed the video on VF.  Today I will
review events with LWC and more review of Aura components and how they will interact with the other components in our project.
Completed a wireframe and will make necessary additions to that today.

Josh will continue working on the project.
